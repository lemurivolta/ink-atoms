# ![](images/icon.png) Ink Atoms

**Ink Atoms** is a package to easily integrate **Ink** in your projects using **Unity Atoms**.

[Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) is a narrative scripting language and middleware aimed at writers, narrative designers and technical writers to manage stories in a game.

[Unity Atoms](https://github.com/unity-atoms/unity-atoms) is a set of tools to decouple components and produce a modular, debuggable and testable Unity project. It is particularly good when interactions between components can be expressed as (shared) variables and events, as story-driven games usually are.
